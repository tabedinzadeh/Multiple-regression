In this project we have data related to the appearance and technical characteristics of the car, based on which we

 want to check the effect of three variable, width and height and length of the car on its weight. The name of our 

data is " automobile.csv ". This analysis is based on multiple linear regression.

The program code is implemented in Python and its name is

 ## "Multiple Linear Regression.py".

By running the program, we find that there is a strong linear relationship between the width and height and length of the car and its weight because the value of r2 is equal to 0.78.
